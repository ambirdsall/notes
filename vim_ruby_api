VIM :: four functions and two classes, each of which has
a handful of attributes and methods.

Functions in the VIM module
VIM::message(msg)
VIM::set_option(arg)
VIM::command(cmd)
VIM::evaluate(expr)

VIM::message(msg)
This displays the string msg on the bottom line (where you usually type ex
commands).

VIM::set_option(arg)
This sets a Vim option just as :set would.

VIM::command(cmd)
This executes an ex command.

VIM::evaluate(expr)
This evaluates expr using Vimâ€™s internal expression evaluator (see :help
expression ) and returns the result as a string.

Classes in the VIM module

VIM::Buffer
  global variables:
    $curbuf # the current buffer object

  class methods:
    current # Returns the current buffer object
    count   # Returns the number of buffers
    self[n] # Returns buffer object n (the first buffer is numbered 0)

  instance methods
    name           # Returns the name of the buffer
    number         # Returns the number of the buffer
    count          # Returns the number of lines
    length         # Returns the number of lines
    self[n]        # Returns line n from the buffer (the first line is numbered 1)
    self[n] = str  # Sets line n in the buffer to str
    delete(n)      # Deletes line n from the buffer
    append(n, str) # Appends a line containing str after line n


VIM::Window
  This class represents a window, which is your view into a buffer. A global
  variable, $curwin, represents the current window, also accessible as
  VIM::Window.current.

  class methods
    current # Returns the current window object
    count   # Returns the number of windows
    self[n] # Returns window object n (the first window is numbered 0)

  instance methods
    buffer              # Returns the buffer object displayed in the window
    height              # Returns the height of the window
    height = n          # Sets the window height to n
    cursor              # Returns a [row, col] array for the cursor position
    cursor = [row, col] # Sets the cursor position to row and col
