#+title Web Server

A project with a more and less ambitious version, or it can be done in two
stages. Once the raspberry pi has the right libraries installed and can run a
server, it is simply a matter of making sure its IP address is static to be able
to access it on the local network.

To access it from the wider world is trickier; I don't believe it's possible to
access it via a URL, because DNS services will not forward internet traffic to
any old where; but the bare IP address of the router will connect to it
directly, rather than via a DNS server like normal. The trick is to forward
traffic to the router at port 80 (i.e. internet traffic) to the pi, which has a
web server program listening on that port and will generate the response.

* Pi
** Install nginx
** Get addresses in order
*** Configure static IP address for pi
*** Get the router's IP address ("gateway" something may be related)
** Set up postgres
* Router
