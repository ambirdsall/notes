Audrey, you are the love of my life and my best friend.
I don't know what our future will be; but I do know how I will go about being your husband in that future:
I promise to be faithful to you, and to be as kind as I can.
I promise to listen to you and take you seriously, even when I disagree.
I promise to make at least a few good jokes along with all the bad ones.
I promise you honesty and good faith.
I promise not to take our relationship for granted;
but to choose, each day, to put in the work, that our love may grow and change as we grow and change through all the years to come.
