Alex:
Do you happen to know of a good place where an out-of-town cousin could get her
hands on a cello? We talked about the possibility of her playing some at the
wedding, but since she's already flying a family out from North Dakota, a local
option for a cello would make it a lot easier to finagle the logistics.

Patrick:
Ok. So, she could rent a cello. For that she should go (call first!) to Roland
Feller at 551 Divisadero. His number is (415) 567-3708. I have no clue what a a
few days' rental would cost - most people are renting on a monthly basis. As
for borrowing another cellist's cello, I have friends who play, of course, but
we are generally really sensitive about about people touching/playing our
instruments. I'd say that should be attempted as a last resort. There are other
luthiers besides Roland Feller, but he is the best so try him first. You should
call him to ask about day rental immediately, even if the wedding's not for a
while. Let me know if you need more suggestions. I'm sure we can get your
cousin a cello one way another. Keep me posted.

SO:
  Roland Feller (415) 567-3708
