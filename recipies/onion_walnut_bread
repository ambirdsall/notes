# Jane Grigson's Walnut Bread from Southern Burgundy

## Ingredients [4 free-form loaves]
5 cups AP flour (preferably unbleached)
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar
2 packages active dry yeast (2 scant tablespoons)
2 cups warm milk
1/2 cup walnut oil (substitutes: fruity olive oil or 1 stick melted, cooled butter)
1/2 cup walnuts, roughly chopped
3/4 cup onion, finely chopped

## Directions
Sift flour, salt, and sugar into a warm bowl.
Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of warm milk and pour it into the middle of the flour, together with the walnut oil/butter and the rest of the milk
Knead well until the dough is firm and blended into a smooth, springy ball (about 10 minutes by hand)
Leave in a warm place to rise for 2 hours or in a cool place overnight
Start the oven preheating to 400°
Punch down the dough, mix in the walnuts and onion, shape into four rounds, and leave on a greased baking tray to rise for 45 minutes
Bake at 400° for 45 minutes, or until the loaves sound hollow when tapped underneath
